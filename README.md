# 📁 PHP CRUD Operations using MVC Architecture

Welcome to this practice project built with **PHP** using the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** architecture! This mini-project demonstrates how to perform basic **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) while integrating **Sessions and Cookies** for state management.
